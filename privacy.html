    <p>A privacy policy is a statement or a legal document (in privacy law) that discloses information about how a party gathers, uses, discloses, and manages a customer or client's data. It adheres to a legal requirement to protect a customer's or client's privacy. Personal information can be any indicator that can be used to identify an individual, which is not limited to the person's name, address, date of birth, marital status, contact information, ID issue, and expiry date, financial records, credit information, medical history, where one travels, and intent to purchase goods and services.</p>
    <p>In the case of a business, it is often used to declare a party's policy on how it collects, stores, and releases personal information it collects. It informs the client about the specific information collected, and whether it is kept confidential, shared with partners, or sold to other enterprises. Privacy policies usually are a broader, more generalized statement, as opposed to data use statements, which tend to be more detailed and specific.</p>
    <p>The specific contents of a privacy policy will depend upon the applicable law and may be required to address requirements across geographical boundaries and legal jurisdiction.</p>
